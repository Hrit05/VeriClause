Security Administrator: The person charged with monitoring and implementing security controls and procedures for a system. Whereas PURPLESEC may have one Information Security Officer, technical management may designate a number of security administrators. System Administrator: The person responsible for the effective operation and maintenance of information systems, including implementation of standard procedures and controls to enforce an organization\u2019s security policy. Overview Computer accounts are the means used to grant access to PURPLESEC\u2019s information systems. These accounts provide a means of providing accountability, a key to any computer security program, for PURPLESEC usage. This means that creating, controlling, and monitoring all computer accounts is extremely important to an overall security program. Purpose The purpose of this policy is to establish a standard for the creation, administration, use, and removal of accounts that facilitate access to information and technology resources at PURPLESEC. Audience This policy applies to the employees, Directors, volunteers, contractors, consultants, temporaries, and other workers at PURPLESEC, including all personnel affiliated with third parties with authorized access to any PURPLESEC information system.

Account Management The following items apply to System Administrators or other designated staff: \u2022 Information system user accounts are to be constructed so that they enforce the most restrictive set of rights/privileges or accesses required for the performance of tasks associated with an individual\u2019s account. Further, to eliminate conflicts of interest, accounts shall be created so that no one user can authorize, perform, review, and audit a single transaction. \u2022 All information system accounts will be actively managed. Active management includes the acts of establishing, activating, modifying, disabling, and removing accounts from information systems. \u2022 Access controls will be determined by following established procedures for new employees, employee changes, employee terminations, and leave of absence. \u2022 All account modifications must have a documented process to modify a user account to accommodate situations such as name changes and permission changes. \u2022 Information system accounts are to be reviewed monthly to identify inactive accounts.

    "text": "Comprehensive IT Policy CONFIDENTIAL-PURPLESEC LLC Policy 3: Anti-Virus Definitions Virus: A program that attaches itself to an executable file or vulnerable application and delivers a payload that ranges from annoying to extremely destructive. A file virus executes when an infected file is accessed. A macro virus infects the executable code embedded in Microsoft Office programs that allows users to generate macros. Trojan Horse: Destructive programs, usually viruses or worms, which are hidden in an attractive or innocent looking piece of software, such as a game or graphics program. Victims may receive a Trojan horse program by e-mail or removable media, often from another unknowing victim, or may be urged to download a file from a web site or download site. Worm: A program that makes copies of itself elsewhere in a computing system. These copies may be created on the same computer or may be sent over networks to other computers. Some worms are security threats using networks to spread themselves against the wishes of the system owners and disrupting networks by overloading them. A worm is similar to a virus in that it makes copies of itself, but different in that it need not attach to particular files or sectors at all. Spyware: Programs that install and gather information from a computer without permission and reports the information to the creator of the software or to one or more third parties. Malware: Short for malicious software, a program or file that is designed to specifically damage or disrupt a system, such as a virus, worm, or a Trojan horse. Adware: Programs that are downloaded and installed without user\u2019s consent or bound with other software to conduct commercial advertisement propaganda through pop-ups or other ways, which often lead to system slowness or exception after installing. Keyloggers: A computer program that captures the keystrokes of a computer user and stores them. Modern keyloggers can store additional information, such as images of the user\u2019s screen. Most malicious keyloggers send this data to a third party remotely (such as via email). Ransomware: A type of malware that prevents or limits users from accessing their system, either by locking the system's screen or by locking the users' files, unless a ransom is paid. Server: A computer program that provides services to other computer programs in the same or other computers. A computer running a server program is frequently referred to as a server, although it may also be running other client (and server) programs. Security Incident: In information operations, a security incident is an assessed event of attempted entry, unauthorized entry, or an information attack on an automated information system. It includes unauthorized probing and browsing; disruption or denial of service; altered or destroyed input, processing, storage, or output of information; or changes to information system hardware, firmware, or software characteristics with or"

This policy is complementary to any other implemented policies dealing specifically with data access, data storage, data movement, and connectivity of mobile devices to any element of the PURPLESEC network. Audience This policy applies to all PURPLESEC employees, including full and part-time staff, and the Board of Directors who utilize company-owned mobile devices to access, store, back up, relocate, or access any organization or member-specific data. Such access to this confidential data is a privilege, not a right, and forms the basis of the trust PURPLESEC has built with its members, suppliers, and other constituents. Consequently, employment at PURPLESEC does not automatically guarantee the initial and ongoing ability to use these devices to gain access to corporate networks and information. Policy Detail This policy applies to any corporate owned hardware and related software that could be used to access corporate resources. The overriding goal of this policy is to protect the integrity of the private and confidential member and business data that resides within PURPLESEC\u2019s technology infrastructure. This policy intends to prevent this data from being deliberately or inadvertently stored insecurely on a mobile device or carried over an insecure network where it can potentially be accessed by unsanctioned resources. A breach of this type could result in loss of information, damage to critical applications, loss of revenue, and damage to PURPLESEC\u2019s public image. Therefore, all users employing a PURPLESEC owned mobile device, connected to an unmanaged network outside of PURPLESEC\u2019s direct control, to backup, store, and otherwise access corporate data of any type must adhere to company-defined processes for doing so. Affected Technology Connectivity of all mobile devices will be centrally managed by PURPLESEC\u2019s IT Department and will utilize authentication and strong encryption measures.

    "text": "Comprehensive IT Policy CONFIDENTIAL-PURPLESEC LLC Purpose This e-commerce policy is to be used as both a guideline and an overview in the management of PURPLESEC\u2019s electronic services. Policy Detail /R PURPLESEC is committed to enhancing member service through the use of many forms of e-commerce activities. Electronic commerce activities include PURPLESEC\u2019s web site, email, telephone access system, ACH transactions, ATM system, online bill payment, and home banking services. They also include business-to-business transactions where interaction is conducted electronically between PURPLESEC and its business partners using the Internet as the communications network. It is the practice of PURPLESEC to safeguard member data at all times, including the processing of e-commerce transactions. Information must be protected at both the sending and receiving ends of each transaction. To accomplish this, there are several levels of protection applied to e-commerce activities. \u2022 Encryption Encrypting transactions provides security by ensuring that no portion of a transaction is readable except by the parties at each end of the transmission. This ensures that data can be transmitted securely without concern that another party could intercept all or part of the transaction. Encryption also makes certain that the transaction is not tampered with as it routes from point to point and data is received exactly as it was sent. PURPLESEC will use a minimum of 128b encryption. This also applies to vendors that host PURPLESEC member data. \u2022 Authentication After a secure connection is established, the initiating party must prove his/her identity prior to conducting the transaction. This is typically handled with user IDs or account numbers, along with password or PIN combinations. Additionally, encryption certificates are also employed to validate the authenticity of both servers and users. System administrators control system access by assigning users different levels of access for applications and data. These access levels are determined by senior management and are specific to each job function. This ensures that access to applications and specific types of transactions are only granted as job functions require. \u2022 Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) For online banking, MFA offers more than one form of authentication to verify the legitimacy of a transaction. The layered defense makes it more difficult for an unauthorized person to gain access. \u2022 Firewalls PURPLESEC will deploy and utilize firewalls as necessary to protect internal systems from threats originating from the Internet, as well as those that might be present when connecting to vendors\u2019 networks. Firewall operating systems and configurations will be reviewed periodically to ensure maximum protection. An"

    "text": "Comprehensive IT Policy CONFIDENTIAL-PURPLESEC LLC audit log will be maintained tracking all attempts to access un-configured (blocked) services. Firewalls and other access devices will be used, as needed, to limit access to sites or services that are deemed inappropriate or non- corporate in nature. Vendor hosted solution firewalls will be reviewed prior to implementation. \u2022 Network Traffic Rules and Restrictions Intra-network traffic is subject to distinct operating rules and restrictions. Through the use of firewall technology, outside parties are directed only to approved, internal resources. An example of this is web page services that allow certain types of traffic from the Internet (web page browsing) but have other types of traffic blocked (i.e. administrative tasks). This strategy dramatically reduces the risk of any party gaining unauthorized access to a protected server. The internal network is also protected from virus attacks through the use of network-level anti-virus software that is updated automatically on a regular basis. These regular updates are loaded automatically to each PC, as they are available. This provides the most up to date virus protection and security available. E-mail is also scanned prior to delivery, reducing the potential of a virus entering the network in this manner. \u2022 Physical Site Security The entire IT Department is protected by a card access entry system allowing only authorized personnel into the Department. Sensitive data, hardware, and software are secured in the PURPLESEC data center, which is secured with a card access entry point and is monitored throughout the day by IT staff. Access to the data center is further limited to a small number of authorized personnel. It is PURPLESEC\u2019s practice to change administrative passwords and immediately remove card access privileges after any change in IT staff. In addition to on-site storage of data, PURPLESEC stores overnight backups of critical systems data and replicated Storage Area Network (SAN) storage to a secure, off-site location. This ensures that data is available in the event of a disaster or other critical situation. \u2022 Staff Training and Review IT staff receives training and reviews all procedures at least annually or as major system additions or changes are implemented. \u2022 User Password Maintenance /R Staff passwords, on the host data processing system, expire after 45 or 90 days, forcing users to modify their passwords. This control, along with a strict PURPLESEC policy prohibiting users from sharing or disclosing their passwords, is intended to prohibit unauthorized access to systems and data. After receiving a change in status from the Human Resources Department or other management team members, IT staff immediately removes user access codes from appropriate systems. \u2022 Expert Assistance PURPLESEC recognizes that e-commerce security issues change daily.

This vendor may also provide technical assistance as new e-commerce related features are added to the system to ensure the continued safety and security of existing systems. \u2022 Communications Network PURPLESEC employs the use of several types of data communication lines including dial-up phone lines, direct point-to-point circuits, and other private and public network connections. Data transmissions are secured, encrypted, and/or password protected, as needed.

Prior to implementation, the Third Party Vendor and PURPLESEC network administrators are required to have the modifications approved by the Director of IT or the VP of IT. All related documentation is to be retained for three (3) years. All firewall implementations must adopt the position of \u201cleast privilege\u201d and deny all inbound traffic by default. The ruleset should be opened incrementally to only allow permissible traffic."

Incidents can include, but are not limited to, unauthorized access, malicious code, network probes, and denial of service attacks. Overview Security Incident Management at PURPLESEC is necessary to detect security incidents, determine the magnitude of the threat presented by these incidents, respond to these incidents, and if required, notify PURPLESEC members of the breach. Purpose This policy defines the requirement for reporting and responding to incidents related to PURPLESEC information systems and operations. Incident response provides PURPLESEC with the capability to identify when a security incident occurs. If monitoring were not in place, the magnitude of harm associated with the incident would be significantly greater than if the incident were noted and corrected. This policy applies to all information systems and information system components of PURPLESEC. Specifically, it includes: \u2022 Mainframes, servers, and other devices that provide centralized computing capabilities. \u2022 Devices that provide centralized storage capabilities. \u2022 Desktops, laptops, and other devices that provide distributed computing capabilities. \u2022 Routers, switches, and other devices that provide network capabilities. \u2022 Firewalls, Intrusion Detection/Prevention (IDP) sensors, and other devices that provide dedicated security capabilities.

End points can include personal computers, personal digital assistants, scanners, etc. Flow: The traffic that corresponds to a logical connection between two processes in the network. IP: Internet Protocol is the method or protocol by which data is sent from one computer to another on the Internet. Packet: The unit of data that is routed between an origin and a destination on the Internet or any other packet-switched network. Overview Most components of the IT infrastructure at PURPLESEC are capable of producing logs chronicling their activity over time. These logs often contain very detailed information about the activities of applications and the layers of software and hardware that support those applications. Logging from critical systems, applications, and services can provide key information and potential indicators of compromise and is critical to have for forensics analysis. Purpose Log management can be of great benefit in a variety of scenarios, with proper management, to enhance security, system performance, resource management, and regulatory compliance. PURPLESEC will perform a periodic risk assessment to determine what information may be captured from the following: \u2022 Access \u2013 who is using services \u2022 Change Monitoring \u2013 how and when services were modified \u2022 Malfunction \u2013 when services fail \u2022 Resource Utilization \u2013 how much capacity is used by services \u2022 Security Events \u2013 what activity occurred during an incident, and when \u2022 User Activity \u2013 what people are doing with services Policy Detail Log generation Depending on the volume of activity and the amount of information in each log entry, logs have the potential of being very large. Information in logs often cannot be controlled by application, system, or network administrators, so while the listed items are highly desirable, they should not be viewed as absolute requirements. Application logs Application logs identify what transactions have been performed, at what time, and for whom. Those logs may also describe the hardware and operating system resources that were used to execute that transaction."

    "text": "Comprehensive IT Policy CONFIDENTIAL-PURPLESEC LLC System logs System logs for operating systems and services, such as web, database, authentication, print, etc., provide detailed information about their activity and are an integral part of system administration. When related to application logs, they provide an additional layer of detail that is not observable from the application itself. Service logs can also aid in intrusion analysis, when an intrusion bypasses the application itself. Change management logs, that document changes in the IT or business environment, provide context for the automatically generated logs. Other sources, such as physical access or surveillance logs, can provide context when investigating security incidents. Client workstations also generate system logs that are of interest, particularly for local authentication, malware detection, and host-based firewalls. Network logs Network devices, such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, routers, and switches are generally capable of logging information. These logs have value of their own to network administrators, but they also may be used to enhance the information in application and other logs. Many components of the IT infrastructure, such as routers and network-based firewalls, generate logs. All of the logs have potential value and should be maintained. These logs typically describe flows of information through the network, but not the individual packets contained in that flow. Other components for the network infrastructure, such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS) servers, provide valuable information about network configuration elements, such as IP addresses, that change over time. Time synchronization One of the important functions of a log management infrastructure is to relate records from various sources by time. Therefore, it is important that all components of the IT infrastructure have synchronized clocks. PURPLESEC uses Network Time Protocol (NTP) for time synchronization. Use of log information Logs often contain information that, if misused, could represent an invasion of the privacy of members of PURPLESEC. While it is necessary for PURPLESEC to perform regular collection and monitoring of these logs, this activity should be done in the least invasive manner. Baseline behavior It is essential that a baseline of activity, within the IT infrastructure, be established and tracked as it changes over time. Understanding baseline behavior allows for the detection of anomalous behavior, which could indicate a security incident or a change in normal usage patterns. Procedures will be in place to ensure that this information is reviewed on a regular and timely basis."

It enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Some VPNs allow employees to securely access a corporate intranet while located outside the office. User Authentication: A method by which the user of a system can be verified as a legitimate user independent of the computer or operating system being used. Multi-Factor Authentication: A method of computer access control in which a user is granted access only after successfully presenting several separate pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism \u2013 typically at least two of the following categories: o Knowledge (something they know) o Possession (something they have) o Inherence (something they are) Dual Homing: Having concurrent connectivity to more than one network from a computer or network device. Examples include: o Being logged into the corporate network via a local Ethernet connection, and dialing into AOL or another Internet Service Provider (ISP) o Being on a PURPLESEC provided remote access home network, and connecting to another network, such as a spouse\u2019s remote access o Configuring an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) router to dial into PURPLESEC and an ISP, depending on packet destination DSL: Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) is a form of high-speed Internet access competing with cable modems. DSL works over standard phone lines and supports data speeds of over 2 Mbps downstream (to the user) and slower speeds upstream (to the Internet). ISDN: There are two flavors of ISDN: BRI and PRI. BRI is used for home/office/remote access. BRI has two \u201cBearer\u201d channels at 64kb (aggregate 128kb) and 1 D channel for signaling information. Remote Access: Any access to PURPLESEC\u2019s corporate network through a non- PURPLESEC controlled network, device, or medium. Split-tunneling: Simultaneous direct access to a non-PURPLESEC network (such as the Internet, or a home network) from a remote device (PC, PDA, WAP phone, etc.) while connected into PURPLESEC\u2019s corporate network via a Virtual Private network (VPN) tunnel. VPN is a method for accessing a remote network via \u201ctunneling: through the Internet. IPSec Concentrator: A device in which VPN connections are terminated. Cable Modem: Cable companies such as AT&T Broadband provide Internet access over Cable TV coaxial cable. A cable modem accepts this coaxial cable and can receive data from the Internet at over 1.5 Mbps."

Password: A string of characters which serves as authentication of a person\u2019s identity, which may be used to grant or deny access to private or shared data. Strong Password: A strong password is a password that is not easily guessed. It is normally constructed of a sequence of characters, numbers, and special characters, depending on the capabilities of the operating system. Typically, the longer the password, the stronger it is. It should never be a name, dictionary word in any language, an acronym, a proper name, a number, or be linked to any personal information about the password owner such as a birth date, social security number, and so on. Overview Passwords are an important aspect of computer security. They are the front line of protection for user accounts. A poorly chosen password may result in the compromise of PURPLESEC\u2019s entire corporate network. As such, all PURPLESEC employees or volunteers/directors (including contractors and vendors with access to PURPLESEC systems) are responsible for taking the appropriate steps, as outlined below, to select and secure their passwords. Purpose The purpose of this policy is to establish a standard for the creation of strong passwords, the protection of those passwords, and the frequency of change. Audience This policy applies to all personnel or volunteers/directors who have, or are responsible for, an account (or any form of access that supports or requires a password) on any system that resides at any PURPLESEC facility, has access to the PURPLESEC network, or stores any non-public PURPLESEC information.

    "text": "Comprehensive IT Policy CONFIDENTIAL-PURPLESEC LLC Policy 18: Patch Management Overview Patch Management at PURPLESEC is required to mitigate risk to the confidential data and the integrity of PURPLESEC\u2019s systems. Patch management is an effective tool used to protect against vulnerabilities, a process that must be done routinely, and should be as all-encompassing as possible to be most effective. PURPLESEC must prioritize its assets and protect the most critical ones first; however, it is important to ensure patching takes place on all machines. Purpose Security vulnerabilities are inherent in computing systems and applications. These flaws allow the development and propagation of malicious software, which can disrupt normal business operations, in addition to placing PURPLESEC at risk. In order to effectively mitigate this risk, software \u201cpatches\u201d are made available to remove a given security vulnerability. Given the number of computer workstations and servers that comprise the PURPLESEC network, it is necessary to utilize a comprehensive patch management solution that can effectively distribute security patches when they are made available. Effective security is a team effort involving the participation and support of every PURPLESEC employee and the Board of Directors. This policy is to assist in providing direction, establishing goals, enforcing governance, and to outline compliance. Audience This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, temporaries, and the Board of Directors at PURPLESEC. This policy applies to all equipment that is owned or leased by PURPLESEC, such as, all electronic devices, servers, application software, computers, peripherals, routers, and switches. Adherence to this policy is mandatory. Policy Detail Many computer operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, and others, include software application programs which may contain security flaws. Occasionally, one of those flaws permits a hacker to compromise a computer. A compromised computer threatens the integrity of the PURPLESEC network, and all computers connected to it. Almost all operating systems and many software applications have periodic security patches, released by the vendor, that need to be applied. Patches, which are security related or critical in nature, should be installed as soon as possible. \u2022 In the event that a critical or security related patch cannot be centrally deployed by IT, it must be installed in a timely manner using the best resources available. \u2022 Failure to properly configure new workstations is a violation of this policy.

This means most of the responsibility for securing the applications and the data falls onto the customer. \u2022 Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. The infrastructure, software, and data are primarily the responsibility of the provider, since the customer has little control over any of these features.

The following outlines PURPLESEC\u2019s minimum system requirements for server equipment supporting PURPLESEC\u2019s systems. \u2022 Operating System (OS) configuration must be in accordance with approved procedures. \u2022 Unused services and applications must be disabled, except where approved by the Director of IT or the VP of IT. \u2022 Access to services must be logged or protected though appropriate access control methods. \u2022 Security patches must be installed on the system as soon as possible through PURPLESEC\u2019s configuration management processes. \u2022 Trust relationships allow users and computers to be authenticated (to have their identity verified) by an authentication authority. Trust relationships should be evaluated for their inherent security risk before implementation. \u2022 Authorized users must always use the standard security principle of \u201cLeast Required Access\u201d to perform a function. \u2022 System administration and other privileged access must be performed through a secure connection. Root is a user account that has administrative privileges which allows access to any file or folder on the system. Do not use the root account when a non-privileged account will do. \u2022 All PURPLESEC servers are to be in access-controlled environments. \u2022 All employees are specifically prohibited from operating servers in environments with uncontrolled access (i.e. offices). This policy is complementary to any previously implemented policies dealing specifically with security and network access to PURPLESEC\u2019s network. It is the responsibility of any employee of PURPLESEC who is installing or operating server equipment to protect PURPLESEC\u2019s technology based resources (such as PURPLESEC data, computer systems, networks, databases, etc.) from unauthorized use and/or malicious attack that could result in the loss of member information, damage to critical applications, loss of revenue, and damage to PURPLESEC\u2019s public image. Procedures will be followed to ensure resources are protected."

PURPLESEC faces exposure of a certain amount of information that can be visible to friends of friends from social media. While this exposure is a key mechanism driving value, it can also create an inappropriate conduit for information to pass between personal and business contacts. Tools to establish barriers between personal and private networks and tools to centrally manage accounts are only beginning to emerge. Involvement by the IT Department for security, privacy, and bandwidth concerns is of utmost importance. Purpose of Using Social Media There are several ways PURPLESEC can benefit from using external (public) social media, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. \u2022 Building a positive image: PURPLESEC can use social media to promote a positive image. While this is particularly important for organizations generally vulnerable to negative press or consumer discontent, it can also be used to boost PURPLESEC\u2019s image within the community. \u2022 Increasing mind share: Social media can reach large audiences at very low monetary cost, giving PURPLESEC another medium for promotion and"

Overview This policy encompasses all new and existing workloads. Purpose The purpose of this policy is to establish server virtualization requirements that define the acquisition, use, and management of server virtualization technologies. This policy provides controls that ensure that Enterprise issues are considered, along with business objectives, when making server virtualization related decisions. Platform Architecture policies, standards, and guidelines will be used to acquire, design, implement, and manage all server virtualization technologies. Policy Detail PURPLESEC\u2019s VP of IT has the overall responsibility for ensuring that policies are followed in order to establish contracts and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PURPLESEC data. Other IT staff members, under the direction of the Director of IT, are responsible for following the procedures and policies within IT. PURPLESEC\u2019s legacy IT practice was to dedicate one physical server to a single workload. The result of this practice was excessive server underutilization, an ever- expanding data center footprint, and excessive data center power consumption. Server virtualization software allows the consolidation of new and existing workloads onto high capacity x86 servers. Consolidating workloads onto high capacity x86 servers allows PURPLESEC to reduce the x86 server inventory, which in turn decreases the data center footprint and data center power consumption. PURPLESEC will migrate all new and existing workloads from physical servers to virtual machines. Hardware will be retired at such time as planned by IT management or required by incompatibility with Operating Systems (OS) and/or workload specific software updates. Server Virtualization Requirements: \u2022 Support industry-wide open-standards \u2022 Embedded security technology, such as, Trusted Platform Module (TPM) or other technologies \u2022 Single centralized management console \u2022 Support industry standard management tools"

Keylogger: The action of recording or logging the keystrokes on a keyboard. Wi-Fi: A term for certain types of wireless local area networks (WLAN) that use specifications in the 802.11 family. Wireless: A term used to describe telecommunications in which electromagnetic waves, rather than some form of wire, carry the signal over all or part of the communication path. Overview This policy addresses the wireless connection of PURPLESEC owned devices in remote locations. Purpose The purpose of this policy is to secure and protect the information assets owned by PURPLESEC and to establish awareness and safe practices for connecting to free and unsecured Wi-Fi, and that which may be provided by PURPLESEC. PURPLESEC provides computer devices, networks, and other electronic information systems to meet missions, goals, and initiatives. PURPLESEC grants access to these resources as a privilege and must manage them responsibly to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all information assets. Policy Detail PURPLESEC Wi-Fi Network The PURPLESEC Wi-Fi network is provided on a best-effort basis, primarily as a convenience to employees and others who may receive permission to access it. For employee business use, it is designed to be a supplement to, and not a substitute for, the production wired local area network. For non-employees, it is also provided as a convenience, primarily as a way for members to access PURPLESEC online products and services. Staff may easily demonstrate PURPLESEC online products and services to members or prospects. Wi-Fi access points, located at the Court Street facilities and in most branch offices, allow for compatible wireless device connectivity. Microwaves, cordless telephones, neighboring APs, and other Radio Frequency (RF) devices that operate on the same frequencies as Wi-Fi are known sources of Wi-Fi signal interference. Wi-Fi bandwidth is shared by everyone connected to a given Wi-Fi access point (AP). As the number of Wi-Fi connections increase, the bandwidth available to each connection decreases and performance deteriorates. Therefore, the number and placement of APs in a given building is a considered design decision. Due to many variables out of direct PURPLESEC control, availability, bandwidth, and access is not guaranteed. The PURPLESEC Wi-Fi network and connection to the Internet shall be:"

Do: \u2022 As with any Internet-connected device, defend your laptop, tablet, phone, etc. against Internet threats. Make sure your computer or device has the latest antivirus software, turn on the firewall, never perform a download on a public Internet connection, and use strong passwords. \u2022 Look around before selecting a place to sit, consider a seat with your back to a wall and position your device so that someone nearby cannot easily see the screen. \u2022 Assume all Wi-Fi links are suspicious, so choose a connection carefully. A rogue wireless link may have been set up by a hacker. Actively choose the one that is known to be the network you expect and have reason to trust. \u2022 Try to confirm that a given Wi-Fi link is legitimate. Check the security level of the network by choosing the most secure connection, even if you have to pay for access. A password-protected connection (one that is unique for your use) is better than one with a widely shared passphrase and infinitely better than one without a passphrase. \u2022 Consider that one of two similar-appearing SSIDs or connection names may be rogue and could have been setup by a hacker. Inquire of the manager of the establishment for information about their official Wi-Fi access point."

    "text": "Comprehensive IT Policy CONFIDENTIAL-PURPLESEC LLC \u2022 Avoid free Wi-Fi with no encryption. Even if your website or other activity is using https (with a lock symbol in your browser) or other secure protocols, you are at much greater risk of snooping, eavesdropping, and hacking when on an open Wi- Fi connection (such as at Starbuck\u2019s, McDonald\u2019s, some hotels, etc.). \u2022 Seek out Wi-Fi connections that use current industry accepted encryption methods and that generally will require the obtaining of a passphrase from the establishment. \u2022 Consider using your cell phone data plan for sensitive activities rather than untrusted Wi-Fi, or your own mobile hotspot if you have one or have been provided with one. \u2022 If you must use an open Wi-Fi, do not engage in high-risk transactions or highly- confidential communication without first connecting to a virtual private network (VPN). \u2022 If sensitive information absolutely must be entered while using a public network, limit your activity and make sure that, at a minimum, your web browser connection is encrypted with the locked padlock icon visible in the corner of the browser window, and make sure the web address begins with https://. If possible, save your financial transactions for when you are on a trusted and secured connection, at home, for instance. Passwords, credit card numbers, online banking logins, and other financial information is less secure on a public network. \u2022 Avoid visiting sites that can make it easier or more tempting for hackers to steal your data (for example, banking, social media, and any site where your credit card information is stored). \u2022 If you need to connect to the PURPLESEC network and are authorized to do so, choose a trusted and encrypted Wi-Fi AP or use your personal hotspot. In every case, you must use your PURPLESEC-provided VPN at all times. The VPN tunnel encrypts your information and communications and besides, hackers are much less likely to be able to penetrate this tunnel and will prefer to seek less secure targets. \u2022 In general, turn off your wireless network on your computer, tablet, or phone when you are not using it to prevent automatic connection to open and possibly dangerous APs. Set your device to not connect automatically to public or unknown and untrusted networks. Finally, Do Not: \u2022 Leave your device unattended, not even for a moment. Your device may be subject to loss or theft, and even if it is still where you left it, a thief could have installed a keylogger to capture your keystrokes or other malware to monitor or intercept the device or connection. \u2022 Email or originate other messages of a confidential nature or conduct banking or other sensitive activities, and definitely not when connected to an open, unencrypted Wi-Fi. \u2022 Allow automatic connection to or connection to first Wi-Fi AP your device finds, as it may be a rogue AP set up by a thief. Rather, choose the one that is known to be the network you expect and have reason to trust."

    "text": "Comprehensive IT Policy CONFIDENTIAL-PURPLESEC LLC Policy 29: Telecommuting Definitions Telecommuting: A work arrangement in which employees do not commute or travel by bus or car to a central place of work, such as an office building, warehouse, or store. Telecommuters often maintain a specific office or workspace and usually work from this alternative work site during predefined days of the week. This is differentiated from teleworking or working remotely, that may refer to casual or occasional remote work done by a traditional employee while away from their traditional company office. Overview Telecommuting allows employees to work at home. Telecommuting is a voluntary work alternative that may be appropriate for some employees and some jobs. Purpose For the purposes of this policy, reference is made to the defined telecommuting employee who regularly performs their work from an office that is not within a PURPLESEC building or suite. Casual telework by employees or remote work by non- employees is not included herein. Focusing on the IT equipment typically provided to a telecommuter, this policy addresses the telecommuting work arrangement and the responsibility for the equipment provided by PURPLESEC. Policy Detail Telecommuting arrangements are made on a case-by-case basis, focusing first on the business needs of the organization. The company may provide specific equipment for the employee to perform his/her current duties. This may include computer hardware, computer software, mobile phone, email, voicemail, connectivity to host applications, and other applicable equipment as deemed necessary. In order to purchase, configure, ship, and install the required equipment to the remote location, the IT Department shall be notified in advance of the telecommuting start date. The use of equipment, software, and data supplies, when provided by PURPLESEC for use at the remote work location, is limited to authorized persons and for purposes relating to PURPLESEC business. PURPLESEC will provide for repairs to or replacement of provided equipment. Damage to equipment owned by PURPLESEC, that is outside the employee\u2019s control, will be covered by the organization\u2019s insurance policy. In the event of such damage, loaner equipment may be provided when available and must be returned upon request. The IT Department will be responsible for all equipment installation, maintenance, security access, support, and necessary training related to PURPLESEC equipment and software at the remote site, even in the event IT chooses to outsource services. All provided, qualified equipment will be tracked in the IT asset program. The employee shall designate a workspace, within the remote work location, for placement and installation of equipment to be used while teleworking. The employee shall maintain this workspace in a safe condition, free from hazards and other dangers to the employee and equipment. All PURPLESEC materials should be kept in the designated work area at home and not made accessible to others. All applicable policies"

    "text": "Comprehensive IT Policy CONFIDENTIAL-PURPLESEC LLC Policy 30: Internet of Things Definitions Internet of Things (IoT): Refers to network or Internet connected devices such as appliances, thermostats, monitors, sensors, and portable items that can measure, store, and transmit information. The IoT connects billions of devices to the Internet and involves the use of billions of data points, all of which need to be secured. Data points: A discrete unit of information. Any single fact is a data point. Overview IoT devices may be business oriented, consumer based, or a hybrid of both. The devices may be company provided or employee owned, such as through a BYOD policy. Purpose The purpose of this policy is to establish a defined IoT structure to ensure that data and operations are properly secured. IoT devices continue making inroads in the business world; therefore, it is necessary for PURPLESEC to have this structure in place. Policy Detail IoT Device Procurement IoT devices that are to be used for company operations should be purchased and installed by IT personnel. Employee-owned IoT devices used for business purposes must be used in accordance with Policy 16, Personal Device Acceptable Use and Security (BYOD). The use of all IoT devices, whether company provided, or employee owned, should be requested via Addendum A, IoT Device Usage Request Form and submitted to the IT department for approval. Only manager level employees and above may request the usage and/or procurement of IoT devices. The IT department is responsible for identifying compatible platforms, purchasing equipment, and supporting organization provided and authorized IoT devices. Cybersecurity Risks and Privacy Risk Considerations It is important for PURPLESEC to understand the use of IoT because many IoT devices affect cybersecurity and privacy risks differently than IT devices do. Being aware of the existing IoT usage and possible future usage will assist PURPLESEC in understanding how the characteristics of IoT affect managing cybersecurity and privacy risks, especially in terms of risk response. It is important for PURPLESEC to manage cybersecurity and privacy risk for IoT devices versus conventional IT devices, determining how those risk considerations might impact risk management in general, risk response and particularly mitigation, and identifying basic cybersecurity and privacy controls PURPLESEC may want to consider, adapt, and potentially include in requirements when acquiring IoT devices. The IoT Risk Management Guide contains insight as to the differences in risk between conventional IT devices and IoT devices. This document resides in the IT document storage area."
